          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>Python is an excellent language for anything from scripting to frameworks like flask. When given a choice I prefer to be able to write scripts in
            python as it is readable, dependable, and often the fastest option for getting something that works. I have been using Python in my homelab for about
            the past 2 years. 
          </p>
          <p>One of my favorite executions of Python I have deployed was an automation to get files from my local machine to a media server I run for my household. 
            It was a pretty small use case but it saved me a good bit of manual labor and prevented me from having to manuall sftp files from my computer to my remote server.

          <h3>Puppet</h3>
          <p>Puppet is an extremely useful language when for setting up and maintaining remote machines. For me this started as a tool that was being used at work, as a new 
            tool for automation and standardization accross a broad group of restaurants. As time has gone on I've been involved in the development and deployment of the tool,
            manifests to standardize configuration at our restaurants, and finding objective data about the restaurants we are maintaining in the field that would not have been known
            at scale without the tool.
          </p>
          <p>One of my favorite applications of this tool has been developing custom facts in order to better understand where configuration drift exists and then using that 
            data to build a plan for eliminating configuration drift. It's also a very useful way to prove out a theory if there is some disagreement in an organization about
            where and what a problem is.

          <h3>Desktop Scripting and development</h3>
          <p>Scripting for desktop applications can be an interesting challenge especially when shortcuts can be coded in and used to expedite the experience of support teams. 
            Some scripts do not really need a lot of user interaction and can be used as a CLI tool. For instance a script that needs to run once on a freshly imaged machine
            will really only need logging so the successful execution of the script can be validated. On the other hand a tool that a support agent or engineer might use to 
            quickly map to and restart a service on a different machine may work from CLI but may be more effective as a GUI especially for a newer agent. 
          </p>
          <p>Being able to write and utilize scripts in the day to day work can be a huge boon not only to a single user but to any user that can also interact with the scripts.
            The upfront can be a little bit time consuming but in the long run it can be an invaluable skill that brings huge cost savings and value to a company.
