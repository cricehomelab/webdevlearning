      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>As long as I can remember I've loved Computers, building things, and exploration.
         My journey the past two years down the path of learning to program, build, and improve my skills has become an obsession for me.
         This all started, for me, as a search for a way to fix things better in my job. My day job is heavily comprised of fixing software issues for POS.
         We've done this in  a pretty labor intensive manner, and have gradually been shifting towards automations, and I wanted to be a part of that.
         I've been lucky enough to have managers who've seen my progress and have found cool challenges for me to fix or teams to collaborate with.
         These challenges and teams have given me new goals and shown me areas I can improve, and places where I can make a bigger difference than fixing
         one machine at a time.

        When I'm not working I love to spend time with my wife checking out the newest movies, or trying the wonderfully diverse cuisine that Columbus Ohio
        has an abundance of. We love going to our local gym and working out. I enjoy playing video game, I am a long time on and off player of World of 
        Warcraft, but outside of that game I love to play survival horror games, ARPG style games, and Borderlands when I want to play a fast paced action 
        game.
