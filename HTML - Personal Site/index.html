      <li>
        Wendy's - Senior Aloha Application Engineer - 2021 to Present
        <ul>
          <li>
            The primary duties of this position is to act as an escalation point and a third level troubleshooting source in resolving production level
            issues. This often leads to looking for and finding scale level solutions for issues in the restaurant environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed troubleshooting processes and wrote support scripts to simplify troubleshooting processes and save time for support personel that
            handle front line calls.

            Escalated issues to support vendors in a timely manner.

          </li>
          <li>
            Created a more efficient field imaging process for imaging Point of Sales terminals by techs in the field. Reduced the downtime of a POS from 
            3-4 hours to about 1 hour. This process also increased the likelyhood of the imaging process being successful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Helped introduce a knowledge management system to my team in the form of Confluence, to help remove silos on our team and in our organization.

            Collaborate with other teams, like our Configuration Management team that codes, configures, and runs Puppet for our restaurants. The goal of
            most of my work with this team has been to identify locations of configuration drift, and automate solutions with Puppet to prevent that drift.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li>

        Wendy's - First Level Support Technician - 2013-2016 - As a front line support agent I worked to resolve customer issues promptly and recognize when a second level team needs to
