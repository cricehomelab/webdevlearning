    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Wendy's - Senior Aloha Application Engineer - 2021 to Present</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The primary duties of this position is to act as an escalation point and a third level troubleshooting source in resolving production level
            issues. This often leads to looking for and finding scale level solutions for issues in the restaurant environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed troubleshooting processes and wrote support scripts to simplify troubleshooting processes and save time for support personel that
            handle front line calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Escalated issues to support vendors in a timely manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trained and mentored colleagues on my team, and other teams to help them orient to the Wendy's Environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created a more efficient field imaging process for imaging Point of Sales terminals by techs in the field. Reduced the downtime of a POS from 
            3-4 hours to about 1 hour. This process also increased the likelihood of the imaging process being successful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Helped introduce a knowledge management system to my team in the form of Confluence, to help remove knowledge gaps and information 
            silos on our team, and more broadly, in the organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Troubleshooting deepdives and Root Cause Analysis for production issues. Developing workarounds, and helping implement long term solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborate with other teams, like our Configuration Management team that codes, configures, and runs Puppet for our restaurants. The goal of
            most of my work with this team has been to identify locations of configuration drift, and automate solutions with Puppet to prevent that drift.
          </li>
          <li>
            Escalate issues to internal teams who build or manage different pieces of software or infrastructure with detailed reports of an issue to help
            move an issue towards a resolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Escalate issues to appropriate external vendors like Microsoft, Givex, Vantiv, Moneris, Panasonic, and NCR with appropriate details for issues 
            relating to issues in the field and collaborating to resolution.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li>
        <strong>Wendy's - Aloha Application Engineer - 2019-2021 -</strong> Worked with my team in a similar but lesser capacity to my role as a Senior
        Application Engineer.
      </li>
      <Li>
        <strong>Wendy's - Specialist - 2016-2019 - </strong>Worked on the support desk as a second level agent. This position is heavily based in support, and 
        involved heavy collaboration with development teams to report issues in a way that helped prioritize them appropriately and in line with the needs of 
        the caller.
      </Li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wendy's - First Level Support Technician - 2013-2016 - </strong>As a front line support agent I worked to resolve customer issues promptly and 
        recognize when a second level team needs to intervene. As a front line agent I learned to lead alongside my colleagues, and looked for support gaps that 
        were unpopular due to their difficulty, or the time required to solve them.
