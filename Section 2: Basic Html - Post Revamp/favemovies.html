<h3>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>
    Best Star Wars movie of all times in my opinion full of action, and adventure
    plus the big reveal of the original trillogy. 
</p>
<h3>Casablanca</h3>
<p>
    One of my favorites not because of the story as much as I remember spending 
    sunday afternoons with my dad watching this between church services.
</p>
<h3>Scott Pilgrim Versus the World</h3>
<p>
    I really like the sound track in this movie and that if you listen to it 
    without watching the film you can get a really good idea of whats going on.
    Either that or I've watched it so many times that the music just helps me 
    picture whats happening.
